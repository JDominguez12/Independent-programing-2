This code I decided to do for the second independent programming assignment is the implementation of the merge sort algorithm. I chose this one in particular because like my previous algorithm involving binary tree, merge sort is another one that has caught my interest.
Merge function creates two temporary arrays that holds elements of two subarrays from left to right. It then copies the elements from the original arrays into these temporary arrays, which will then be used to be sorted in the function mergeSort. Whne mergeSort is called recursively, it will then sort the arrays from left, middle, and right so that the array is then organized from least to greatest. Lastly, printArray iterates through each array and prints out each element that was sorted, printing out both the original array and the sorted array.
This is an interesting algorithm because of how coding can both split and separate the arrays, as well as merging it together in a different order. I can see this being useful when implementing a database system that requires a sorting algorithm, especially when storing large amounts of data that one would have to manage.
